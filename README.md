# Codeventure #1
On the bus ride home from an adventure, I had an idea for staying focused while coding. I call it 'Codeventure'"

"It's a coding challenge where each participant creates a folder with their name to showcase their Godot creations. To keep things lively, we'll have a few guardians to watch for extended AFK moments and ensure a fair challenge."

## The Theme : "FightClub"

"I saw yesterday the movie Fight Club and i thought i would be funny if we at Thursday the 28.09.2023 the first Codeventure with the theme of the movie Fight Club, where we figth who is the best Coder in the light of the current Unity Refugess Crisis."

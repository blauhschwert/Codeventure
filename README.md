# Codeventure #0
On the bus ride home from an adventure, I had an idea for staying focused while coding. I call it 'Codeventure'"

"It's a coding challenge where each participant creates a folder with their name to showcase their Godot creations. To keep things lively, we'll have a few guardians to watch for extended AFK moments and ensure a fair challenge."

## The Theme : "Saw"

"I don't know how I ended up with a Saw-themed idea, but hey, creativity knows no bounds! I'll keep conjuring up unique themes for our upcoming codeventures because I'm as creative as a magician, always ready to surprise those around me."

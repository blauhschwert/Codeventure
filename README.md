# Codeventure
On the bus ride home from an adventure, I had an idea for staying focused while coding. I call it 'Codeventure'"

"It's a coding challenge where each participant creates a folder with their name to showcase their Godot creations. To keep things lively, we'll have a few guardians to watch for extended AFK moments and ensure a fair challenge."
